# Differential network analysis to find gene clusters correlated to abiotic stress in plants.

Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. 

Here we use the WGCNA to find correlated genes in multiple abiotic stress in plants. We test seven different stress treatments in citrus plants: water stress (WS), high irradiance/light (HL), heat stress (HS), high irradiance and heat stress combination (HL + HS), water stress and high irradiance combination (WS + HL), water stress and heat stress combination (WS + HS) and the combination of water stress, high light and heat stress.  The count data and metadata were taken from: Damián Balfagón, Zandalinas, S. I., dos, T., Claudete Santa‐Catarina, & Gómez‐Cadenas, A. (2022). Reduction of heat stress pressure and activation of photosystem II repairing system are crucial for citrus tolerance to multiple abiotic stress combinations.
